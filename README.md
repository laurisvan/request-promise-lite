# request-promise-lite

This is a lightweight HTTP Promise client, somewhat compatible with
[request-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request-promise) for node.js 4 or later. It can be used as a replacement where the original client is too heavy, e.g. as part of AWS Lambda functions, or with WebPack.

## Usage

Request in request-promise style:

    var request = require('request-promise-lite)'

    request.get('https://httpbin.org/get', { json: true })
      .then((response) => {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(response));
      });

Use bundled classes (Request):

    var url = 'https://httpbin.org/get';
    var req = new request.Request('GET', url, { json: true });

    req.run()
      .then((response) => {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(response));
      }

Use bundled classes (StreamReader):

    var filePath = path.resolve(__dirname, './fixtures/sample.json');
    var stream = fs.createReadStream(filePath);
    var reader = new request.StreamReader(stream);

    reader.readAll()
      .then((output) => {
        console.log(output.toString());
      }

Use bundled classes (StreamReader):

    var error = new request.RequestError('I'm a teapot!', 417, 'teapot');

### Supported options

Node.js [http/https request options](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v4.x/docs/api/http.html#http_http_request_options_callback)
are passed forward as-is. In addition the following shorthand options are supported:

    // Options & their default values
    let defaults = {
      headers: {},      // The headers to pass forward (as-is)
      maxRedirects: 3,  // How many redirects to follow
      json: false,      // JSON shortcut for req headers & response parsing
      agent: false,     // The HTTP agent for subsequent calls
      body: {},         // Payload in body
      qs: {},           // Will be parsed into a query string e.g. {key: value} => /?key=value
      resolveWithFullResponse: false, // Resolve with the response, not the body
      verbose: false,   // Whether or not run the requests in verbose mode
    };

## Building

The code has been writen in es2015 and transpiled in [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). The transpilation can be run with gulp:

    > gulp build             # If you have gulp in your path
    > npm run-script build   # Use gulp devDependency
    > gulp watch             # Trigger rebuild & test on file changes
    > gulp test              # Run mocha tests & several validators
